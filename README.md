An old lab excercise about server deadlocks.

This program was created for a university lab about http requests and deadlocks. The goal is to communicate with a web server to make a wedding appointment, which consists of both a hotel and a band. Because multiple bookings were being made at once by other lab members avoiding deadlock situations was important.

Note: Because the server used for this lab is no longer reachable this program can no longer book anything. Please look elsewhere for your wedding needs.
